First Assignment in SDS392 Fall2021:

 This is the algorithm to sorting a bag of potatoes


  Requirements:
   Potatoes in a bag
   Know the number of potatoes
   Flat surface
   Desired number of piles

  Parameters:
   Kind of sorting i.e. by size (not: color, dimples, etc)
   Number of piles desired i.e. Large/Medium/Small

  Logic: 
   Upon placement of potatoes on a flat surface 
   sepeprate potatoes into 3 piles
   can go into more piles after the initial 3

  Algorithm:

   1. Dump potatoes on flat surface
   2. Group them into 3 piles regardless of size
   3. Choose largest one to lead the big pile
   4. Choose the smalles to lead the small pile
   5. Seperate them one by one to its closest size, will end up with two piles
   6. Choose the smallest potato in the pile of the big potatoes and place it as a medium pile
   7. Choose the biggest potato in the pile of the small potatoes
   8. Repeat step 6 and 7 until you have about the same number of potatoes in all 3 piles
